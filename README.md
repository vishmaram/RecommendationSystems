2) Building popularity based recommender by using python pandas library
3) Recommending similar items based on correlation using pandas
4) Machine learning classification methods to make collaborative filtering system
by using the logistic progression model from scikit-learn library
5) Model based collaborative system by using the truncated SVD model also from scikit-learn
6) Content based recommender by using the nearest neighbor approach
7) Evaluate the completeness and precision of the models by using the 
scikit-learn's classification metrics
